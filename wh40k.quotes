A retinal after-image that fades and is obscured forever by newer,
brighter lights.

The Daemon has many forms.
You must know them all.
You must tell the Daemon from his disguise and
root him out from the hidden places.
Trust no-one.
Trust not even yourself.
It is better to die in vain than to live an abomination.
The zealous martyr is praised for his valour:
the craven and the unready are justly abhorred.

You ask why we must cleanse the xenos. I will tell you.
The filth of the alien and the witch must be exterminated
to preserve the purity of the Human race,
lest we degenerate into abomination.

Would you have Mankind grow old and withered,
running too fat on the fruits of remembered glory
whilst its enemies tear at its frail extremities?
I think not. With each trial, we become stronger.
My brethren and I will provide.

The absence of faith is the mark of the weak.
The absence of faith is the mark of the heretic.
The absence of faith is the mark of damnation.

Where there is uncertainty, I shall bring light
Where there is doubt, I shall sow faith
Where there is shame, I shall point atonement
Where there is rage, I shall show its course
My word in the soul shall be as my bolter in the field.
